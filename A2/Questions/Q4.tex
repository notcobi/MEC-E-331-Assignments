Air enters a nozzle steadily at $\rho = \qty{2.21}{\kilogram\per\meter\cubed}$ and $u = \qty{20}{\meter\per\second}$ and leaves at 
$\rho = \qty{0.762}{\kilogram\per\meter\cubed}$ and $u = \qty{150}{\meter\per\second}$. If the inlet area of the nozzle is 
$A_1 = \qty{60}{\centi\meter\squared}$, determine

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item the mass flow rate through the nozzle, and
    \item the exit area of the nozzle.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{}
First determine the mass flow rate through the nozzle. The mass flow rate is given by:

\[
\begin{aligned}
    \dot{m} &= \rho_1 A_1 u_1 \\
    &= 2.21 \times 60 (0.01)^2 \times 20 \\
    &= \boxed{\qty{0.265}{\kilogram\per\second}}
\end{aligned}
\]

\subsection{}
Next, determine the exit area of the nozzle. Since mass flow rate is constant throughout the nozzle, 
the mass flow rate at the exit is the same as the mass flow rate at the inlet. 

\[
\begin{aligned}
    A_2 &= \frac{\dot{m}}{\rho_2 u_2} \\
    &= \frac{0.265}{0.762 \times 0.01^2 \times 150} \\
    &= \boxed{\qty{23.2}{\centi\meter\squared}}
\end{aligned}
\]
